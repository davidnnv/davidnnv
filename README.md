# Front-End Dev | Minimalist JavaScript Enthusiast

I'm David, a front-end developer who's all about that vanilla JavaScript life, keeping things simple, and having a good time building cool stuff on the web.

## About Me

- 💻 Dev Vibes: I code because I enjoy it, and I don't take myself too seriously.
- 🎨 Style: I make websites look pretty and function smoothly, all while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
- 🌌 JavaScript Fan: I prefer to stick with good old vanilla JS, but I can bust out a bit of jQuery magic if needed.
- 🔥 Projects: I've whipped up a bunch of stuff. Some are impressive, some are weird, but they're all a product of my wild imagination.
- 🛠️ Tools: I know my way around CSS, but Flexbox and Grid are my ride-or-die for layouts.
- 🚀 Learning: I'm learning new stuff one step at a time.
